# Blue Cheese ðŸ§€

A minimal, clean, elegant dark theme for Visual Studio Code. Based off the beloved [One Dark Pro theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme) with completely revamped colors.

I thought making a VSCode theme was going to be easy, but man was I wrong!
A lot of very time-consuming specific tweaking.
I have a lot of respect for people who write and maintain themes.
Feel free to fork or use the palette.
